Description: A systematic biology tool was developed to identify cell infiltration via Individualized Cell-Cell interaction network. 'CITMIC' first constructed a weighted cell interaction network through integrating Cell-target interaction information, molecular function data from Gene Ontology (GO) database and gene transcriptomic data in specific sample, and then, it used a network propagation algorithm on the network to identify cell infiltration for the sample. Ultimately, cell infiltration in the patient dataset was obtained by normalizing the centrality scores of the cells.
